Hello and welcome to my project!
The purpose of this app is to quickly create playlists over Spotify quickly.

I was inspired to create this with COVID and my issue with passing my phone around
for others to add songs to a queue or a playlist. I figured, why hasn't somebody stream
lined collabrative playlists? Spotify currently has local listening as a beta and it isn't
quite the most robust experience yet.

# Oct 14th Standup

We did it! We have the spotify webplaybacksdk up and running!
This does create some more components to create.
We now need to create a component that lists and selects a device for playback,
but having this up and running has made this project into a actual usable web app.

# Today's Menu

1. Update coverart with hooks to update via next, prev, current song.
2. Create the device_id component that will update state with device_id.

# Known bugs

1. Router seems to not play well with my pages. Will need up look over documentation on reactRouter, Links, etc. and update code accordingly.
