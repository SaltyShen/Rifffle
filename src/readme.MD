Hello and Welcome to my Spotify web app!

The purpose of this app is to quickly create playlists over Spotify quickly.
The inspiration for this web app was I was bothered by the fact I listen to the same
playlists over and over again on Spotify. 

I thought, "Why not make a web app that makes searching new music quick?"

My intention is to create a web app with coverart of songs that autoplay onHover() 
with the mouse so you can get a quick preview of a song and add them all into a 
playlist based on a selection of genre, artist, etc. 

Currently I have OAuth completed and am able to grab the access_token.
 The next few objectives will be to create ajax calls for the various things 
 that the Spotify API offers and then to put it together.


future developement will be noted on this MD.
