# introduction
Hello and welcome to my project!
The purpose of this app is to quickly create playlists over Spotify quickly.

I was inspired to create this with COVID and my issue with passing my phone around
for others to add songs to a queue or a playlist. I figured, why hasn't somebody stream
lined collabrative playlists? Spotify currently has local listening as a beta and it isn't
quite the most robust experience yet.

### March 4 Update
UI updated with ionic buttons. Assets seem to be a hard commodity to come by these days, but I'm glad I've finally found one that seems to be
UI agnostic. (Thanks reddit/r/webdesign.) Overall the player component is very robust now. All buttons and API calls are complete. This will be the final iteration besides a few design choices as well as a few more buttons to be added (ig. repeat, like, volume.) 

Progression bar also needs to be updated with a scrolling feature such that you can click on it and the playback will resume at a specific position.

Other features that need to be updated is selecting songs and catagorial and organization components such as playlists and searching. 

The API built off spring is being developed currently and should be done given I learn more about the powerful features of spring.

### March 5 Menu

1. Develope the other leading player components and implement them into the player.
2. Develope organizational components and have them also implemented into the web app.
3. Continue the developement of the Riffle API.

### Known bugs
Currently no bugs to my knowledge, but I'm sure they will come as I improve functionality. Let me know if there are any bugs!
